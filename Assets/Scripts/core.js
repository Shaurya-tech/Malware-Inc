<br><br>
They are in the form of messages, and these messages pretend to originate from large organisations, and can be sent via SMS, email, or social media platforms.
<br><br>
Phishing can affect everyone, regardless of education, gender, level of activity online or the type and size of business

<h2>Types of phishing</h2>
-Spear phishing: Another variation of mainstream phishing where they target a specific class of people or various organisations, rather than random, everyday people
<br><br>
-This is a more dangerous version of phishing, as they are more authentic and the stakes are higher, as corporate and government data loss could occur if hackers and scammers are successful
<br><br>
-It is also more dangerous for targets because not even trained professionals can detect phishing attempts without major difficulty
<br><br>
-An example of this is you receiving an email from your company's tech department, asking you to verify your email and password
<br><br>
-Spear phishing uses social engineering, a technique which involves manipulating people into doing something, especially something malicious such as divulging confidential information</p>`);
  p.push(`<p>Phishing has been active for over a decade, having first appeared in Australia in 2003, but phishing methods have become more thorough and sophisticated, making it difficult to distinguish between an actual message and a phishing attempt
<br><br>
Initially, it was easy to distinguish malicious messages from genuine ones because phishing messages were badly written or had grammar or punctuation errors, but in recent times, scammers and criminals have made their messages more authentic
<br><br>
As a result of phishing, businesses are no longer allowed to contact you to update or verify your username or password, PIN's, credit card information, account details etc. They also can't ask for payment over the phone, such as for a financial penalty or a bank transfer

A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system. These actions can include:

<br><br>
Deleting data
<br><br>
Blocking data
<br><br>
Modifying data
<br><br>
Copying data
<br><br>
Disrupting the performance of computers or computer networks

An umbrella term referring to a malicious program that infects your device and collating data about you, such as your bank account details and email addresses, and your browsing history and other data related to you.
Spyware usually finds itself onto your device without your knowledge or permission, and maintain a presence on your PC.
The criminal may collected data from you by capturing keystrokes, screenshots, authentication credentials, personal email addresses, web data such as internet usage information, and credit card numbers

<br><br>
<h2>Spyware can infect computers by</h2>
<br><br>
Security vulnerabilities: Those who use and exploit spyware use security vulnerabilities on your device to gain access to your computer and start recording data about you. This may occur by you clicking an unfamiliar link from an email or attachment, clicking an option in a deceptive and suspicious pop up window, and trading documents and files with friends, which may include trading music files, documents or executable programs which house a spyware program

<br><br>
Misleading marketing: Spyware creators may present their programs as useful tools you can download. This may include programs that accelerate your connection to the internet, a download manager, a hard disk drive cleaner and management tool, or an alternative search engine. Be vigilant when encountering these requests to install the software, because it may include a spyware program. Even if you realise that the installed program houses spyware, and you uninstall it, the spyware will still be there.

<br><br>
Mobile spyware: Mobile spyware has existed ever since mobile devices become commonplace.
Mobile devices are small and users cannot view activity, the operations of spyware can run unobstructed.
Mobile devices, particularly Mac and Android, become affected instantly when installing a malicious app. These malicious apps can be constituted of legitimate apps remade with malicious code, completely malicious apps with a fake name, and apps with fake download links.

<br><br>
<h2>Types of Spyware</h2>
Password stealers- Applications designed to obtain passwords from infected computers. Potential passwords include email passwords stored on web browser and system credentials. Password stealers may store data on a device of the attacker's choosing, such as a server in a separate location for retrieval
<br><br>
Banking Trojans- Harvest credentials from financial institutions. They operate by exploiting web security vulnerabilities and may modify web pages, transaction content by inserting or deleting transactions. Targets for this class of spyware include banks, brokerages, online financial portals or digital wallets.
<br><br>
Keyloggers- Application designed to accumulate data about computer activity, including keystrokes, websites visited, search history, email discussions, chatroom dialogue, and system credentials. They typically collect screenshots of the current window at scheduled intervals. Keyloggers may also collect functionality, allowing for stealthy capture and transmission of images and audio/video from any connected devices.

Public references to the term “spyware” date back to late 1996, when it appeared in an industry article. By 1999, it was used in an industry press release, described as we define it today. The term was an instant hit in the mass media and among its audiences. Soon after, in June 2000, the first anti-spyware application was released.
In October 2004, America Online and the National Cyber-Security Alliance performed a survey. The result was startling. About 80% of all Internet users have their system affected by spyware, about 93% of spyware components are present in each of the computers, and 89% of the computer users were unaware of their existence. Out of the affected parties, almost all, about 95%, confessed that they never granted permission to install them.
<br><br>
At present, and in general, the Windows operating system is the more favorable target of the spyware applications, thanks to its widespread use. However, in recent years spyware developers have also turned their attention to the Apple platform, as well as to mobile devices.

Don't download files unless they originate from a reputable source
<br><br>
Hover over hyperlinks before clicking on them to ensure you are visiting the right webpage

<br><br><br>
But as people have gotten smarter about cyber self-defense, hackers have turned to more sophisticated spyware delivery methods, so installing a reputable cybersecurity program is necessary to counter advanced spyware.
Look for cybersecurity that includes real-time protection. Real-time protection automatically blocks spyware and other threats before they can activate on your computer. Some traditional cyber security or antivirus products rely heavily on signature-based technology-these products can be easily circumvented, especially by new threats.
You should also look out for features that block the delivery of spyware itself on your machine, such as anti-exploit technology and malicious website protection, which blocks websites that host spyware. The premium version of Malwarebytes has a solid reputation for spyware protection.

Ransom malware, or ransomware, is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to regain access. The earliest variants of ransomware were developed in the late 1980s, and payment was to be sent via snail mail. Today, ransomware authors order that payment be sent via cryptocurrency or credit card.
<br>
There are several different ways that ransomware can infect your computer. One of the most common methods today is through malicious spam, or malspam, which is unsolicited email that is used to deliver malware. The email might include booby-trapped attachments, such as PDFs or Word documents. It might also contain links to malicious websites.

<br><br>
<h2>Types of Ransomware</h2>
There are three main types of ransomware, ranging in severity from mildly off-putting to Cuban Missile Crisis dangerous. They are as follows:
<br><br>
Scareware - Scareware includes rogue security software and tech support scams. You might receive a pop-up message claiming that malware was discovered and the only way to get rid of it is to pay up. If you do nothing, you'll likely continue to be bombarded with pop-ups, but your files are essentially safe.
<br>
A legitimate cybersecurity software program would not solicit customers in this way. If you don't already have this company's software on your computer, then they would not be monitoring you for ransomware infection.
<br><br>
Screen lockers - When lock-screen ransomware gets on your computer, it means you're frozen out of your PC entirely. Upon starting up your computer, a full-size window will appear, often accompanied by an official-looking FBI or US Department of Justice seal saying illegal activity has been detected on your computer and you must pay a fine. However, the FBI would not freeze you out of your computer or demand payment for illegal activity. If they suspected you of piracy, child pornography, or other cybercrimes, they would go through the appropriate legal channels.
<br><br>
Encrypting ransomware - This is the most dangerous type of ransomware.The reason why this type of ransomware is so dangerous is because once cybercriminals get ahold of your files, no security software or system restore can return them to you. Unless you pay the ransom-for the most part, they're gone. And even if you do pay up, there's no guarantee the cybercriminals will give you those files back.

Unless you pay the ransom-for the most part, they're gone. And even if you do pay up, there's no guarantee the cybercriminals will give you those files back.
<br><br>
The first ransomware, known as PC Cyborg or AIDS, was created in the late 1980s. PC Cyborg would encrypt all files in the C: directory after 90 reboots, and then demand the user renew their license by sending $189 by mail to PC Cyborg Corp. The encryption used was simple enough to reverse, so it posed little threat to those who were computer savvy.
<br><br>
With few variants popping up over the next 10 years, a true ransomware threat would not arrive on the scene until 2004, when GpCode used weak RSA encryption to hold personal files for ransom.
<br><br>
In 2007, WinLock heralded the rise of a new type of ransomware that, instead of encrypting files, locked people out of their desktops. WinLock took over the victim screen and displayed pornographic images. Then, it demanded payment via a paid SMS to remove them.
<br><br>
With the development of the ransom family Reveton in 2012 came a new form of ransomware: law enforcement ransomware. Victims would be locked out of their desktop and shown an official-looking page that included credentials for law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and Interpol. The ransomware would claim that the user had committed a crime, such as computer hacking, downloading illegal files, or even being involved with child pornography. Most of the law enforcement ransomware families required a fine be paid ranging from $100 to $3,000 with a pre-paid card such as UKash or PaySafeCard.
<br><br>
Average users did not know what to make of this and believed they were truly under investigation from law enforcement. This social engineering tactic, now referred to as implied guilt, makes the user question their own innocence and, rather than being called out on an activity they aren't proud of, pay the ransom to make it all go away.
<br><br>
Finally, in 2013 CryptoLocker re-introduced the world to encrypting ransomware-only this time it was far more dangerous. CryptoLocker used military grade encryption and stored the key required to unlock files on a remote server. This meant that it was virtually impossible for users to get their data back without paying the ransom. This type of encrypting ransomware is still in use today, as it's proven to be an incredibly effective tool for cybercriminals to make money. Large scale outbreaks of ransomware, such as WannaCry in May 2017 and Petya in June 2017, used encrypting ransomware to ensnare users and businesses across the globe.

Do not provide personal information when answering an email, unsolicited phone call, text message or instant message. Phishers will try to trick employees into installing malware, or gain intelligence for attacks by claiming to be from IT. Be sure to contact your IT department if you or your coworkers receive suspicious calls.
<br><br>
Use reputable antivirus software and a firewall. Maintaining a strong firewall and keeping your security software up to date are critical. It's important to use antivirus software from a reputable company because of all the fake software out there.
<br><br>
Do employ content scanning and filtering on your mail servers. Inbound e-mails should be scanned for known threats and should block any attachment types that could pose a threat.
<br><br>
Do make sure that all systems and software are up-to-date with relevant patches. Exploit kits hosted on compromised websites are commonly used to spread malware. Regular patching of vulnerable software is necessary to help prevent infection.
<br><br>
If traveling, alert your IT department beforehand, especially if you're going to be using public wireless Internet. Make sure you use a trustworthy Virtual Private Network (VPN) when accessing public Wi-Fi like Norton WiFi Privacy.

  rk.push(`<p>
A rootkit is a clandestine computer program designed to provide continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence. The term rootkit is a connection of the two words "root" and "kit." Originally, a rootkit was a collection of tools that enabled administrator-level access to a computer or network. Root refers to the Admin account on Unix and Linux systems, and kit refers to the software components that implement the tool. Today rootkits are generally associated with malware - such as Trojans, worms, viruses - that conceal their existence and actions from users and other system processes.

<br><br>
<h2>What can a rootkit do?</h2>
<br>
A rootkit allows someone to maintain command and control over a computer without the computer user/owner knowing about it. Once a rootkit has been installed, the controller of the rootkit has the ability to remotely execute files and change system configurations on the host machine. A rootkit on an infected computer can also access log files and spy on the legitimate computer owner's usage.

<br><br>
<h2>Detecting rootkits</h2>
<br>
It is difficult to detect rootkits. There are no commercial products available that can find and remove all known and unknown rootkits. There are various ways to look for a rootkit on an infected machine. Detection methods include behavioral-based methods (e.g., looking for strange behavior on a computer system), signature scanning and memory dump analysis. Often, the only option to remove a rootkit is to completely rebuild the compromised system.

<br><br>
2003: This rootkit is called Vanquish. It works in user mode and has a malicious payload which logs passwords
Haxdoor is a rootkit which works by acting as a backdoor and using rootkit techniques to hide its presence in the target's system. It works in Kernel mode

Many rootkits penetrate computer systems by piggybacking with software you trust or with a virus.
